[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findplan_env.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "plan_env",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "plan_env" with any
  of the following names:

    plan_envConfig.cmake
    plan_env-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "plan_env" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "plan_env_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "plan_env" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
